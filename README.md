# BIP! Citation Classifier

The BIP! Citation Classifier is a comprehensive Python library designed to classify citations based on their intent, utilizing a range of state-of-the-art algorithms. 
This tool utilises the citation context found within scientific publications, analysing the text surrounding a reference to determine the intent (or purpose) behind the citation. 
By leveraging a well-established citation classification ontology, the library categorises citations into specific classes, such as whether a citation supports, uses, or extends the work being cited.
The outputs of the BIP! Citation Classifier are particularly useful for tasks such as citation network analysis, where understanding the nature of each citation can significantly improve the accuracy of various analyses.
